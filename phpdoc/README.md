# Bluewater API Reference (PHPDoc)

This directory hosts the auto-generated API documentation for the Bluewater PHP framework, created using [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org/).

- Browse `index.html` for the full class, method, and interface reference.
- This content is generated from the source code and PHPDoc comments in the [bluewater-framework](https://github.com/BluewaterMVC/bluewater-framework) repository.

**Contribution:**  
Do not edit files here directly.  
To update the API reference, modify PHPDoc comments in the framework code, then regenerate and sync the docs as described in [SYNC_PROCESS.md](../SYNC_PROCESS.md).
