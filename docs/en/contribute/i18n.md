# Internationalization (i18n) Contribution Guide

## Overview

Bluewater Framework is committed to making all technical and user-facing documentation accessible in multiple languages. This guide will document standards, workflows, and best practices for contributing translations to the project.

---

## Goals

- Enable contributors to provide accurate, high-quality translations of technical documentation.
- Ensure all documentation updates in English are efficiently propagated to supported languages.
- Maintain consistency, quality, and version parity across all language versions.

---

## Translation Workflow (To Be Expanded)

1. **Create documentation and updates in `/en/` (English) first.**
2. For new translations:
    - Mirror the file and folder structure in the appropriate `/es/`, `/fr/`, etc. directory.
    - Use clear naming conventions consistent with the English originals.
3. Submit a pull request for translations with a summary of the work and any challenges or context.
4. All translation PRs will be reviewed for accuracy and technical consistency before merging.
5. Refer to the Translation Request template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/translation_request.md` for guidance on proposing or requesting new translations.

## Best Practices (To Be Expanded)

- Translate content **faithfully**—convey meaning and technical accuracy over literal word-for-word translation.
- Keep formatting, headers, and code snippets consistent with the English version.
- Note and report if the source (English) documentation is unclear or out-of-date.
- Add translation-specific comments if there are nuances, regional considerations, or terminology choices that need explanation.
