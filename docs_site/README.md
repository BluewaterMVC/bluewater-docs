# Bluewater Documentation Site

This folder contains the configuration and assets needed to publish Bluewaterâ€™s documentation as a website using GitHub Pages.

- Site generator: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), or static site builder of your choice.
- Content: Pulled from `/architecture/`, `/technical/`, and optionally `/phpdoc/`.
- Configuration: `mkdocs.yml` (for MkDocs), `docusaurus.config.js` (for Docusaurus), etc.

**Deployment:**  
The site is published automatically via GitHub Actions when content changes are merged into `main`.

**See also:**  
[SYNC_PROCESS.md](../SYNC_PROCESS.md) for details on how source docs are kept up to date.
