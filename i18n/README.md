# Bluewater Documentation Translations (`i18n/`)

This directory organizes and publishes translations of Bluewater documentation into multiple languages.

---

## Structure

- `en/` — English (default, always up-to-date)
- `fr/` — French
- `es/` — Spanish
- `...` — Other language codes as needed

Each language folder should mirror the structure of the main documentation folders (such as `architecture/` and `technical/`), using translated filenames and content.

---

## Translation Guidelines

- Keep translations as close as possible in structure to the original English docs.
- Use clear, correct language; technical terms should be consistent.
- Collaborate with other native speakers for proofreading if possible.
